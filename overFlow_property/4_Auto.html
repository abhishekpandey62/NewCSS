    <div>Hell Abhishek Christmas falls on 25th December in the whole world.

         Jesus Christ was the true reflection of forgiveness.
        
         People sing, dance, and meet each other during Christmas.
        
         People also offer gifts to friends and relatives.
        
        Children enjoy the day of Christmas in the most exciting manner.
        
         Children wait for Santa Clause to visit their house.
        
         Santa drops gifts for the children in the middle of the night.
        
         We go on a picnic with family and friends during the holiday.
        
         We go out to shop for a Christmas tree with our family.
        
         We should celebrate Christmas with love.
